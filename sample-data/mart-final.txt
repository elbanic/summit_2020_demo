AmazonBasics DSLR-Kamerarucksack für Spiegelreflexkameras und Zubehör schwarz|Ich schreibe diese Rezension nachdem ich den Rucksack schon ein paar Monate in Gebrauch habe.<br /><br />Positiv:<br />Es passt erstaunlich viel hinein:<br /><br />Kameragehäuse DSLR Canon 600D<br />Teleobjektiv Canon 4/70-200mm<br />Makro Tamron 90 mm<br />Weitwinkel Canon 24mm<br />Canon Normalobjektiv 50mm<br />Regenschutzhülle für den Rucksack (nicht enthalten, habe ich mir für 10,- € nachträglich gekauft)<br />zusätzlich noch in die Taschen jede Menge Zubehör.<br />Auch bei längeren Wanderungen war der Rucksack angenehm zu tragen.<br /><br />Negativ:<br />Bei längeren Wanderungen geht der ganze Schweiß in den Innenraum, er ist dann relativ feucht.<br />Diebstahlschutz ist praktisch nicht vorhanden. Der Rucksack ist auch dann zu öffnen wenn er sich auf dem Rücken befindet.<br /><br />Ansonsten eine eindeutige Kaufempfehlung, die negativen Punkte sind dem Preis geschuldet. Wer eine preisgünstige Möglichkeit sucht sein Kamerazubehör durch die Gegend zu tragen, sollte sich diesen Rucksack mal genauer anschauen.<br /><br />5 Punkte, weil mehr geht für den Preis einfach nicht.|asics

ASICS Women's GEL-Resort 2 Walking Shoe|My exercise shoes have more breathability but if you walk in wet grass your socks are instantly wet.  I wanted a shoe that didn't have those holes on top for breathability so when we are on vacation walking where it may be wet my socks stay dry.  Very comfortable.|asics
ASICS Women's GEL-Sayuri Running Shoe|These are the most comfortable running shoes I've ever had! They are so light and flexible I almost feel like I don't have a shoe on (compared to some running shoes, anyway). I don't get nearly as sore in my ankles after a long run anymore.<br />I will definitely be buying a few more pair so that I can have them on hand. The price was great and I get a lot of compliments on the color, too! :)<br />Only downside is that they don't keep my feet warm when it's cold out, but few shoes do.|asics

Canon Office and Business MX922 All in One Printer, Wireless and mobile printing|This was easy for me to setup with my mac computer and wifi.  I use it in my home and it is more than adequate to meet my needs with the paper tray.<br /><br />The scan function works well and was easy to use.  I don't scan a lot of things but what I did scan, I didn't notice a discernible difference between this and my 6 year old printer.<br /><br />What I like most is being able to print from my iphone and iPad as my other printer did not have this capability.<br /><br />What I didn't like is that it seemed slow to print something, however, it isn't any slower than my other printer---I was just hoping it would be faster.<br /><br />This is a large printer.  If you want to use the fax it will need to be near a phone line and the size may prohibit its placement.<br /><br />I previously had an HP printer.  I like this printer better because it seems to print photos better, has AirPrint, and has duplex printing.|caon

Nike The Overplay VII Basketball Shoes|It is real leather with good quality. However, it is more suitable for a pair of slim feet. I feel a bit tight since my feet are a little wide. My suggestion for later buyers is if you have a pair of slim feet, then try them on, and the price is quite reasonable.|nike
Nike Action Men's Lunarridge OMS Shoes|A lot of positive to the shoe/boot. It is very lightweight but still keeps your warm in temps just under freezing and are wearable indoors without getting to hot. The sole is grippy in snow/ice and very comfortable. My first experience with the lunarlon foam and I like it a lot. The orange is bright but not to standoutish. I have dozens of other shoes and all in 12's. In a size 12 it is a bit tight, more form fitting than uncomfortable with the athletic socks I wear them with and I think they will break in a bit over time, but you may consider moving up a half size especially if cold weather wear is actually your goal and you plan on wearing thick socks or two pairs. I did try two pair of thin athletic socks and they were very tight in the forefoot.<br /><br />The negative for me is the leather type tongue. The whole shoe is leatherish and a bit stiff but again should break in. The edges of the tongue though bite into my inner ankle bones. They are hard and sharp and the upper tongue is very stiff. I am hoping they will break in as well but after three days I have red marks and sore spots. Moleskin is helping. Not using the upper lace holders helps but then the shoe fits loose and the laces look to long. The rest of the shoe is a solid 5 at the clearance price I got them at, but even cheap doesn't overcome painful. Really want to like these so will wear them for a while to work on the tongue.<br /><br />Update: after 7 days of 8 hour per day wear the tongue is breaking in and no longer causing an issue. Disappointed it took so long but I really liked the rest of the shoe enough to give it the time. Still recommending you size up a half as it is very tight in the forefoot with a thick sock or even two thin pairs even after 50 or so hours of wear. Also seem just a touch short vs. a usual 12.|nike

Coaster Occasional Sofa Table|Love the look of this table in the front room.  Pretty easy to put together by myself. About the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the bottom two shelves. They don't seem very sturdy to me. I really wish they were the same as the top.  But overall for the price I paid, it's a very nice table to have in the front room. I read the reviews from other buyers. Most had minor complaints about the condition of the table pieces...scratches and such. Mine came in great shape and the finish matches the tables it purchased from IKEA. I would definitely purchase again.|casio

Casio Men's A178WA-1A Illuminator Watch|My husband has had a similar Casio with the rubberized band for years but the band kept getting caught on things so he asked for a bracelet style.  This watch serves its purpose beautifully. He uses the stopwatch feature all of the time.  The bracelet band is very easy to adjust and he loves that the date and day of the week and date are so prominently displayed.  If you're looking for a digital watch that is comfortable and durable, look no further.|casio
Casio Men's WV58DA-1AV Waveceptor Digital Atomic Sport Watch|It is accurate, and the layout of the screen is quite good. However: I set the watch to Mountain Time, 24 hour clock, and no beeps, and it will randomly, and silently, reset itself to Eastern time, 12 hour, and all beeps. It is very frustrating.<br />And, as others have noted, most of the front of the watch is chromed plastic, and the &#34;chrome&#34; wears off easily.<br /><br />Update 10/8/16: I've finally figured out that the watch resets itself when the battery begins to fail, so now I just get the battery replaced when that happens.|casio

Casio Men's DB360-1AV Digital Databank Watch|This replaced a 15 year old databank.  The styling is nicer than the old one.  They both have all the same functions.  The new watch has multiple language capability.  If you only use English, the phone number display is strange.  One digit each of the area code and exchange are very large.  The 4 digits of the number ave very small.  My old DB-34 was much easier to read.|casio

Casio Men's A178WA-1A Illuminator Watch|Performs exactly as advertised.  The bracelet happened to fit perfectly, but adjusting it (it seems to be adjustable) might be a problem.<br />Amazon's price is lower than at both Casio's website and Sears/Target's.|casio

Ikea Mammut Blue Kid's Children's Table|I needed a &#34;step stool&#34; for an aging 100 pound hound dog to be able to get into my truck.

I was amazed at how stable and sturdy this item is, PERFECT for my needs and can't imagine that a human child could do any harm to it.  I covered mine with non-skid carpet and I have a light weight PERFECT step stool for the dog.  Not the normal use, but I can definitely attest to the quality and durability of this little table.|ikea

Sony KDS-R60XBR2 60-Inch SXRD 1080p XBR Rear Projection HDTV|We spent about 3 months researching and looking at TVs that were at least 58\\", 1080P, and had a bright clear image quality and wide viewing angles. None of the LED TVs came close to meeting the size requirement so we nixed them. All the DLP and LED DLP rear projection TVs seemed very dim and could not be viewed at an angle, although the price was right. The ony plasma that was 1080P and 58\\" was way too expensive, although it did have awesome picture quality. <br /> <br />We were about to give up and wait for the price of the plasma TVs to drop, but then stumbled across this beauty. It had incredible picture quality, wide viewing angles, and pretty decent sound. The only negatives were that it had a lot of extra features that drove up the price (like PIP) that we did not care about and took up a huge amount of space (the speakers add over a foot to the length of the unit). Since we really liked this TV, we overlooked the negatives and bought it. While it did look big in the cavernous store, once it was delivered to our living room, it became a gargantuan dinosaur. It dwarfed our living room and we ended up visiting 5 furniture stores trying to find a stand that was big enough to fit it.  <br /> <br />To make a long story short, the size and weight of this beast was too much and we decided to return it and wait for the plasma pricces to drop. While we made the trip back to the store, we stumbled across the Samsung HL-T6176S (which had just been released that very day). We were amazed that this 61\\" DLP TV had similar picture brightness and quality but was MUCH MORE compact (11\\" deep and 55\\" wide) and about $600 less. While the Sony did have some advantages (better remote, some extra features, slightly brighter picture) we felt that its 24\\" depth and 71\\" width made it a dinosaur that we did not want to be stuck with. <br /> <br />If you want a >60\\" tv that is 1080p, compact, and still has near plasma picture quality, then I suggest you pass on the Sony XBR2 and either wait for the plasma prices to fall or check out the Samsung 61\\" Samsung HL-T6176S.|sony

Panasonic Prestige NN-SD688S, 1.2-Cubic Foot 1300 Watt Sensor Microwave Oven, Stainless Steel|Nice, good looking microwave.  Warms food and cooks frozen entrees very well.  Like the \\"more/less\\" feature to avoid over or undercooking.  Sensor reheat works well.  Only complaints are that sometimes it overcooks popcorn by about 20 seconds and it doesn't seem to want to set level on the countertop (have tried 4 different locations).|panasonic
Panasonic NN-SD997S Genius "Prestige" 2.2 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology & Blue Readout, Stainless Steel|Paid $206 for a Panasonic Prestige NN-2D997S, 2.2 CF 1250 Watt Stainless Steel Microwave oven.  It arrived right on time at 5:00PM, Friday, Dec. 9.  We plugged it in, started it up at full power and the dedicated 20-amp fuse blew immediately.  Set the unit to operate 15 seconds at 10% power, started it and again blew the fuse instantly.  Though this oven was given a 4-star rating by a total of 84 buyers, we should have paid more attention to the 16 buyers who rated it 1-star as ours fell into this category.    I e-mailed Amazon.  They instructed me to call their supplier J&R Music/Computer World when they opened on Saturday morning.  Called J&R in the morning and was given instructions on what paperwork would be necessary to return the oven.  J&R e-mailed me a UPS shipping label and more instructions on shipping.  Unless I wanted to pay an additional $8.08 for UPS to pick the box up at our home, I would need to transport it to the nearest UPS Store.  We placed the unit back in the original package, taped it up, affixed the required label and J&R return number and took it to UPS; unfortunately they close at 3:00PM on Saturday (we arrived at 3:04PM), so we will be driving the 45 minute round trip again Monday morning.    We have purchased many goods from Amazon over the years, but have not had to return a defective product until this incident.  Due to the time-consuming process and potential cost (if package is picked up by UPS), we will think twice about ordering appliances from Amazon rather than a local retailer who requires only the returned product and a receipt to refund one's money on the spot rather than e-mails, phone calls, shipping documents and heaven knows how many days to receive a refund.|panasonic
Panasonic NN-SD377S 0.8 cuft, 800 Watt Stainless Steel Microwave Oven, Auto Cook|I purchased this as a replacement for a counter top unit that went bad after 5 years.

Panasonic NN-SN657S 1.2 cuft, 1300 Watt Stainless Steel Microwave Oven, Inverter Technology|Bought this unit at Costco several years ago+.  While it worked, it worked very good.  Nice power.  Outperformed a cheaper \\"second microwve\\" of another brand.  Many great features.  The biggest thing to remember, Panasonic no longer makes magnetrons for this unit, according to my local repair shop.  Not a good sign in my book, the model is not That Old, and no parts???  I was probably at fault when my unit began arcing, but here's a tip for those of you who have one.  There's a small device, just inside the door, on the right wall, covered by a small plate about 1.5\\" by 4\\" held by 3 slots and 1 screw.  Keep the outside clean, occasionally unplug and remove cover, clean out any debris, being careful of the bulb-like object inside, and clean out the debris that's there, replace the cover in its slots and refasten screw making sure the cover is flush with the wall.  Keeping the cover and the inside clear may help you get longer life out of your unit.  (I am not a repairman, this is not professional advice.)  And in my own case ... :)  Make sure to take the metal lids off those plastic-top instant soup containers. :) Hah.|panasonic
Panasonic Genius 1250 Watt Sensor Microwave w/Inverter Technology|And no one, I mean no one, could beat it.  It has everything you could want.  And all the local stores wanted to sell me a smaller one for more money.  With fewer options.  Take the challenge if you don't believe it, all of the local salesmen (and passive big box stores) gave up when I compared this to what they had on the shelves.  It has more power, more options, and a cheaper price tag in comparison.  And very importantly, more cubic feet.  We are very happy with this microwave, and we've had it for about ten months now.|panasonic
Panasonic NN-SD377S 0.8 cuft, 800 Watt Stainless Steel Microwave Oven, Auto Cook|very happy with mic-easy to figure out, cooks popcorn to perfection, small but I've been able to fit anything into it and doesn't take much space up on the counter|panasonic
Panasonic Prestige NN-SD688S, 1.2-Cubic Foot 1300 Watt Sensor Microwave Oven, Stainless Steel|Bigger than expected. Stainless looks great. Sensor reheat works perfect. Cooks much faster & even than my old microwave of 5 years. I am 6' and can read the display fine on 48\\" countertops. Other reviewers must have a very small kitchen to be unable to read the display.  Usage is only about 3-5 times a week for 2-3 minutes tops so I will not be able to give an accurate review on durability. I am a heavy stove/grill user.|panasonic

Philips GoLite P1 Blue Spectrum Light Therapy Device|I moved from California to the Pacific Northwest. Every year near February or March I would have to take anti-depressants for about 2 months. This year I looked for another way to get through \\"Spring\\" in Astoria. I came across the goLITE just browsing the Costco coupon book! I thought it was worth a try. I love it. I plug it in at my desk when I get to work and keep it on for 30 minutes. No one has complained! Sometimes others will even stand near it for a few minutes.  If you are considering this light, I do recommend it.|philips
Philips AmbientLED 11-Watt Medium Base PAR30L Indoor Flood|We just purchased and installed several Philips AmbientLED PAR30L (11W) and PAR38 (16W) floodlights to replace several 45-Watt Halogens and a handful of compact PAR-type fluorescents (all Philips). Our motivation was primarily to reduce energy consumption in high traffic areas where we have several recessed lights and eliminate the long ramp-up to full brightness on some of the CF's. I have been eyeing LED replacement bulbs for some time, but have been disappointed previously in the light quality (poor CRI -- Color Rendition Index) and a typically bluish cast to the light -- typical of early LEDs.    After trying these new Philips AmbientLED bulbs, this marks an inflection point in the promise of architectural-grade LED lighting for residential and commercial use. While they still don't quite match the warmth and instant-on of halogens, they come close enough to consider them as acceptable replacements in most situations.     As with all new technologies, there are tradeoffs, which I highlight here. Since many details are left off the product description, I will provide key highlights. All in all, I rate these as \\"4-stars\\", but with a 5-star build quality. I deduct 1 star for the \\"early adopter\\" price point at the time of writing (about 10-15x the price of a high quality, comparable Halogen lamp). This alone will be a show-stopper for most consumers until the prices come down to earth. That said, let's take a look at the pros and cons of these lamps:    PROS:    BUILD QUALITY. Build quality is superior to any lamp I've seen. These have a cast metal housing that feels substantial. The metal helps to dissipate the heat generated by each of the LEDs. The heat is small compared to traditional incandescent -- hence, these are much more efficient. However, removing heat quickly from the core of the LED is essential to maintaining long-term reliability and avoid overheating the junction temperature of the LED. To avoid overheating, these should not be placed in an \\"enclosed\\" downlight, but rather, an \\"can type\\" recessed light with an exposed underside (where you can see the bulb directly).    SIZE. Compared to some of the PAR-type compact fluorescents, these lamps are quite compact and seem to recess well into the cans (we have Lightolier -- but other cans like HALO should work well).    LIGHT QUALITY. Although a halogen technically has a CRI of 100 (CRI is a critical factor that determines the precision of color rendition), these have a respectable CRI of 85 -- which is better than most compact fluorescents. If you stick with a color temperature in the 3000K range, these lamps give off a bright white light that brings out the natural colors in the room. If you stare straight at them, they are very bright. I expect that the CRI of these bulbs will improve over time, and eventually move into the low 90's range as LED technology improves in the next few years.    LONGEVITY. The life span of these Philips LED lamps is touted to be 25,000 hours, or over 15 years when operated at least 4 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Of course, other electronics could fail, so this is just an estimate. Philips back these up with a 6-year warranty -- so at least you're covered for that long. The long life means you can pretty much install and forget these unless you experience an infant failure. Of course, that also means fewer trips up the step ladder to replace hard-to-reach recessed lights.    UL APPROVED. Unlike some 3rd-party imports, these carry the Philips brand and have passed UL approved for safety and fire ratings. I wouldn't mess around with anything else but a reputable brand that has been engineered and tested to perform safely and reliably. These are made in China, but presumably to Philips specifications and design.    CONSIDERATIONS:    INSTANT ON: Well, not quite. While the packaging states that these are \\"instant on\\" -- there is a noticeable delay of perhaps 0.5 seconds or so from the time you flip the switch to the time the light begins to operate. It's enough of a delay to be a little annoying since you don't get that \\"instant\\" feedback compared to incandescents. For a moment, I thought there was a problem with the lamps. While annoying, I believe we'll get used to this delay and it is certainly better than what you get with typical fluorescents. Once on, they are on full brightness, so there is no waiting from that standpoint. I suspect there is some circuitry in the lamps to regulate the voltage to the LEDs, and this takes a split second to fully charge prior to activating the lamp.    NOT DIMMABLE. Although some newer LED lamps are dimmable (usually with special dimmers), these are not. So, if you plan to install these into an area with an existing dimmer circuit, they will not operate properly and you could damage the bulb. The lack of dimming feature means we can't replace all our bulbs yet with the LED varieties -- but I've heard that the European versions made by Philips are dimmable -- so I expect it's just a matter of time before they release a dimmable version for the US market.    BEAM SPREAD. These initial lamps have a beam spread of 25-degrees -- which is somewhat between a true Flood (40 degrees) and a spot (10-15 degrees). This means you can stock fewer types of lamps, but you may find that the light is more intense and focused than the Floods you're replacing. This may cause dark spots on the floor or surface depending on the lamp spacing. In most cases, this isn't a big problem, but you should be aware nonetheless.    INCOMPATIBILITY WITH CERTAIN LIGHTED SWITCHES. This is an odd one, but some LED lamps (particularly the smaller single lamps, such as flame-tip chandelier LED buld (also by Philips), are not compatible with certain lighted switches. For example, we have installed some of the new Leviton Acenti lighted switches that have a small blue LED to indicate whether the switch is on or off. However, when feeding an LED lamp, it relies on leakage current throughthe lamp to light the LED on the switch. Since LED lamps require so little current to activate, the small leakage current (likely just a few milliamps) is enough to turn the target lamp on even though the switch is \\"OFF\\". When you turn on the switch, the lamp gets brighter. This was a very odd result that I didn't anticipate and it may only occur with some of the smaller, single LED type lamps that may have simpler power regulators compared to the PARs. At some point, switch vendors and lamp vendors will need to sort out this little problem by making sure that all switches are compatible with LED lamps.    COST. The biggest drawback of these lamps is their initial cost. Although energy savings will mount over time, the true ROI may not be there at first. However, if your time horizon is long -- and you want to do your part to reduce energy waste, these are sure to get you on the right path.    PACKAGING. Probably in order to have retail shelf appeal, these lamps are way overpackaged with a lot of waste. They are difficult to remove from the packaging, requiring wire cutters or good scissors. If you have a few lamps to replace, it's not a big deal. But if you have dozens, you'll wish the packaging were simpler and less wasteful. Considering these LED lamps are synonymous with \\"green building\\" and \\"waste reduction\\" -- the packaging is way overdone and is the most frustrating part of the user experience. What happened to the simple box that you just open and pull out the bulb with one hand? If you have serious arthritis, you'll need help to get these lamps out of their packaging. Philips needs to fix this to be more user-friendly and less wasteful.    SUMMARY. All in all, these Philips LED lamps get 4-stars. The missing star can be earned by addressing some of the considerations noted above. They appear to be very well made (they feel good to hold them in your hand) -- and they produce a high quality white light well suited to most residential and commercial applications. These are the first wave of architectural-grade halogen replacements for indoor use. If you can absorb the cost and don't mind some of the initial drawbacks, these appear to be excellent products that will set the bar for the next generation of LED lighting. I expect prices to come down in the next few years as demand increases and traditional incandescents are phased out. They also do no have the mercury problem inherent to most compact fluorescents. As our landfills get full of CFLs and they break, mercury will leach out into the soil, creating another toxic mess with which to contend. If you've been waiting for a quality product that produces good light and color renditioning, I don't think you'll be disappointed with these new AmbientLED lamps from Philips.|philips
Philips AmbientLED 16-Watt Medium Base PAR38 Indoor Flood|We just purchased and installed several Philips AmbientLED PAR38 (16W)and PAR30L (11W) floodlights to replace several 45-Watt Halogens and a handful of compact PAR-type fluorescents (all Philips). Our motivation was primarily to reduce energy consumption in high traffic areas where we have several recessed lights and eliminate the long ramp-up to full brightness on some of the CF's. I have been eyeing LED replacement lamps for some time, but have been disappointed previously in the light quality (poor CRI -- Color Rendition Index) and a typically bluish cast to the light -- typical of early LEDs.     After trying these new Philips AmbientLED bulbs, this marks an inflection point in the promise of architectural-grade LED lighting for residential and commercial use. While they still don't quite match the warmth and instant-on of halogens, they come close enough to consider them as acceptable replacements in most situations.     As with all new technologies, there are tradeoffs, which I highlight here. Since many details are left off the product description, I will provide key highlights. All in all, I rate these as \\"4-stars\\", but with a 5-star build quality. I deduct 1 star for the \\"early adopter\\" price point at the time of writing (about 10-15x the price of a high quality, comparable Halogen lamp). This alone will be a show-stopper for most consumers until the prices come down to earth. That said, let's take a look at the pros and cons of these lamps:     PROS:     BUILD QUALITY. Build quality is superior to any lamp I've seen. These have a cast metal housing that feels substantial. The metal helps to dissipate the heat generated by each of the LEDs. The heat is small compared to traditional incandescent -- hence, these are much more efficient. However, removing heat quickly from the core of the LED is essential to maintaining long-term reliability and avoid overheating the junction temperature of the LED. To avoid overheating, these should not be placed in an \\"enclosed\\" downlight, but rather, an \\"can type\\" recessed light with an exposed underside (where you can see the bulb directly).

Philips Norelco 7240XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver|I can't improve over most of the review's that are already printed for this product, but I hate to shave.  I used a Remington for two years and eventually got away from it.  I wanted to purchase, one more time, a razor that would at least give me a reasonably good shave without going to take a loan out to purchase it.  So after reading the reviews for this razor I bought it.  I really like it. I will admit that I cannot shave without a pre-shave.  Not withstanding, It is a good ride for my face.  I do not use it in the shower.  Actually I have used one before, not this one, and the razor pulled more hair out than it cut.  So I won't recommend this razor to be used in a wet environment.  Well worth the cost, and you can buy replacement heads at WalMart!  What a deal what a deal.|philips
Philips Norelco Bodygroom Replacement Trimmer/Shaver Foil|As a black male model with sensitive skin (and beard), I live by this razor for giving such a quick, wonderful close shave; I often give the bodygroomer as a gift plus I've been ordering the replacement heads for years now and believe me when I say that I have used it to shave EVERYTHING in my line of work. I highly recommend it to ANYone who suffers from ingrown hairs in their beard or simply endures hyper-sensitive skin (no matter where that skin is).|philips
Tissot Men's T17158652 PRC 200 Chronograph Watch|wow! this is a great watch. I use it as my main travel watch because i don't want to scuff up my fancier watches. here are some pros and cons.  PROS:  Nice Looking  Easy to change the time (for travel)  Great chronograph  Durable    CONS:  Very heavy  The date mechanism sometimes doesn't work (very rare, happened once in the 4 years Ive had it but i thought i would include it)|tissot
Tissot Men's T17148655 PRS200 Chronograph Watch|I received this watch as a gift from a friend who ordered it from Amazon. I looked at the watch in the store(national Jewelry) before ordering. One thing I noticed is the band from Amazon is different than the store bought one. The store bought one weighs a little more and moves more easily and is more flexible and has more depth and dimension to it. Thus, it makes it feel more substantial.  For a 3rd comparison, I went to Macy's and the band from Macy's is the same one as from Amazon.  So, either the Jewelry store one is different, or the band style has changed form the manufacturer. Not sure which one.  I wish the one from Amazon had the band I prefer, but other than that, the watch is beautiful and very nice and the price is right.|tissot
Tissot Men's T0104171703100 T-Trax Chronograph Black Rubber Strap Watch|I bought this watch as I was looking to add another Tissot to my collection with a rubberized band. I checked several sites on price and came back to Amazon as they beat the next best site that I would trust by $200. There are only 3 or 4 sites that I trust to purchase a time piece from and Amazon is one of them. The watch is fairly light and can be worn with casual attire or business attire. This is a great watch for a budget minded collector.|tissot

Tissot Men's T34148832 T-Classic PR50 2000 Chronograph Watch|I liked the watch but the date function doesnot work properly. The date changes at 12 noon as opposed to 12 midnight. I spoke to customer care. They promised to replace it. But they said they didnot have one in stock. I am stuck with the watch. Ideally they should give me a replacement watch, whichever  I order now if they want the amazon brand to be recognized for quality. I like to buy from amazon but will not be a happy customer if nothing is done about my watch.|tissot
Tissot Men's Watch T36131672|I just received this watch.  It is much nicer than the picture suggests.  Substantial and well made, with a very nice band - although somewhat stiff but will break in I'm sure.  Compared to other Tissot offerings, it is reasonably priced as well.  The only slight drawback is that the \\"set knob\\" (the middle one) does not screw in which may suggest an increased chance at water damage.  However, overall, I'm quite pleased with this.  As other reviewer's mentioned, the second hand is actually dark blue.  The date is a bit hard to see in the photo, but is at the six o'clock position.|tissot

It has all the features that I wanted -- an attractive, unique face; wearable for both work and casual; second sweep hand; inconspicuous calendar window; and a secure clasp.    I have a larger-than-standard wrist (about 7-3/4 in.) and this fits perfectly.  Smaller wrists may need to remove a link or two.|tissot
Tissot Men's T17158642 T-Sport PRC200 Chronograph Stainless Steel Blue Dial Watch|This is my first Tissot and I was a bit concerned since I´ve never bougth a watch on line.

Bosch GMS120 Digital Multi-Scanner|I got this based on a review I saw where someone said they tested several stud finders and this one was the best.  That reviewer must have been paid by Bosch, because this stud finder does not work at all! I have tried to use it on several different jobs, and it is worthless.  I have tried it on both metal stud walls and on wood stud walls, it will get you within six inches of the stud, but that is no help at all. Now I don't even try to use it any more, because I know it will not tell me anything valuable.  I would try to sell it on ebay, but I know whoever buys it is going to accuse me of selling a broken tool, so I think I will just throw it in the trash.|bosch
Bosch GMS120 Digital Multi-Scanner|Love this! It's fun to use.  It can detect several things not just wiring and the center hole guarantees getting the mark in the exact location.  It works well for hanging things on the walls - especially in the kitchen where we never know where the water pipes or electrical cords are set behind the walls.  Same for the bathroom.  I've had several of my friends ask how I hung things where they have been afraid to.  Use this to place a cat door in the wall rather than the door.  Now the cats have their own entrance without my having to watch if I'm pushing open a door while they are trying to get in.  They have their own &#34;porch&#34; now too.  This is one of the most handy tools I own.|bosch
Bosch GMS120 Digital Multi-Scanner|This scanner works really well. I read a lot of reviews and spoke to others who owned the product, fortunately I was given the good advice that you have to make sure you reset it between detections by pressing the relevant button for a short period before your next scan. With this simple procedure I have had 100% success. I tested not using the reset function and it is basically made useless as it doesn't detect anything.<br />Conclusion - great tool when used properly.|bosch

In a 94 Grand Caravan 3.3L I got over 75,000 miles use before replacing and they were still performing well.    In an '89 Honda Civic 1.5L they improved my fuel economy several mpg and they seemed to give me more mid-range torque and better accelleration in the 1500-2500 rpm range.    I've read mixed reviews from others, so they may not be right for every vehicle or driving condition, but they work well for me.
